    "RL problems are expressed in terms of a system consisting of an **agent** and an **environment**.  The environment is described in terms of **states** that the agent can be in.  The agent interacts with the environment by taking an **action** when in a particular state, which causes the environment to _probably_ transition to a new state along with a **reward** (or **penalty**).  This cycle is performed in a single time step and repeats until the problem is solved (i.e., the object is achieved).\n",
